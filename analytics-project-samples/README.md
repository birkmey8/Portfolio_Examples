# Analytics Project Samples

This portfolio repo contains two representative examples of my work in product analytics and experimentation:

1. **A/B Testing – Modal Video Hero** (`/ab-testing-modal`)  
   HTML/CSS/JavaScript (jQuery) implementation of a hero redesign that opens a modal video. Includes event hooks you’d use to instrument engagement and conversions.

2. **LookML + SQL – GA4 Campaign Analytics View** (`/lookml-sql-model`)  
   A sanitized LookML view that models GA4 purchase events, user properties, and campaign attribution fields for downstream dashboards.

> Note: These examples are *representative* and contain no proprietary data. They show my approach to building experiments and analytics models that are production-ready and measurable.
